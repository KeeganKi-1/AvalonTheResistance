    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>This game is played with 5-10 players. A certain amount of players will be assigned the role of good and a
        certain amount will be assigned the role of evil. The amount is determined by the amount of people and can be
        seen with the more detailed rule book linked at the bottom. All evil players will know who the other evil
        players are. The good players will not know who anyone is except Merlin. Merlin will know who all the evil
        players are. Merlin is one of the good characters and is randomly assigned.
        Merlin may not want to reveal his identity since if the evil characters can determine who Merlin is at the end
        of the game they may assasinate him and will win. Every turn a random person is assigned the role of team
        leader. The team leader will assign people to a quest a=one of these people may be him/herself. There are 5
        total quests that must be completed each has a different amount of players required to complete the quest that
        depends on the amount of players playing. Once the players are selected for the quest all players vote if this
        team should attempt to complete the quest or not. If the vote passes then all players doing the quest chose to
        sabatoge or not. If one person sabatoges the quest fails else wise the quest succeeds. If three successful
        quests occur the side of good wins. If three quests fail the side of evil fails. If the vote declines the party
        a new party leader is chosen and a new team is assembled and a new vote is cast. This repeats up to 5 times and
        then the quest is considered failed. Here is a link to the full rules: <a
